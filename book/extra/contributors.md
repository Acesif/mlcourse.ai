Although led by [Yury Kashnitsky](https://yorko.github.io/), the course is developed by the [OpenDataScience (ods.ai)](https://ods.ai) community. More than 100 community members stepped in helping with editing, proof-reading, translating the materials, assisting course sessions, etc. There are just too many people to acknowledge here (including Patrons), but to name a few contributors, we'd like to thank:

 - [Alexey Natekin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natekin/) for continuous dedicated development of the [OpenDataScience](https://ods.ai) community;
 - [Aleksandr Lozhechnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandr-lozhechnik-40021263/) for long-lasting help with the course website;
 - [Egor Polusmak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egor-polusmak/?originalSubdomain=ru) for a major contribution to translation and proof-reading.

 Many thanks for your support, guys! It was great to see your dedication and enthusiasm, just for the sake of doing the right thing, not to earn money.

 _The list will be updated shortly to acknowledge many more contributors._
